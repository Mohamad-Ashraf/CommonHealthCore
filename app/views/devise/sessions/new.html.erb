    Welcome to the Common Health Core application signup and customization wizard.<br>

    This site provides a simple but flexible method of connecting a new application to the Common Health Core (CHC).
    The CHC a cloud-based network of service providers sharing responsibility for patients/clients medical, dental,
    behavioral, social and community health needs.  CHC makes it possible to implement state of the art health models
    including Social Determinants of Health, population health management, community-based health and others that
    require close collaboration between HIPAA Covered Entities and non-covered services such as community housing,
    financial, nutrition, education, justice and more.  The CHC serves as a hub, connecting social and health service
    providers for referrals.  CHC is a platform for managing referral selection, initiation, tracking and completion
    and documentation.  Any provider easily can create their own application to access the CHC, or implement one of
    our reference applications.  We offer a reference application starter kit which is implemented using the popular
    Wordpress suite.<br>

    Each application is customized in this setup wizard by defining user roles and access rights, workflow stages and
    notifications, and referral directory.  All CHC capabilities are accessed by applications using an
    Application Programming Interface (API).   The wizard helps you use the CHC features without major changes to
    your existing processes.  Within this website there context specific documentation explaining the use and
    requirements for each setting.
